# Electric Rail
A factorio mod that add a new item called Electric rail, behaves like regular rails does, but also transports electricity.

## Getting started - windows
Run the script `install.ps1` with PowerShell. This will copy the content of the `src` folder to Factorio's mods folder and also starts Factorio automatically.

## Getting started - mac
Copy the content of the `src` folder to Factorio's mods folder and inside of a new folder with the name `electric-rail_0.0.1` and start Factorio.
Or make a symlink: `ln -s ~/Projects/Factorio/electric-rail/src /Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/factorio/mods/electric-rail_0.0.1`
